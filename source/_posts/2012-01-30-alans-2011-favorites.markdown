## Favorite Links of 2011

[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) - between the Android app, Reeder for iPad, and the website, keeps me up to date on the news.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and other Stack Exchange sites - one of the best ways to get help and help others.

[9GAG](http://9gag.com/) - thanks to (our summer intern) Vicky for showing this to me, I waste a lot of time looking at internet memes.

## Best Entertainment of 2011

[Friday Night Lights](http://www.nbc.com/friday-night-lights/) - the final season was aired on NBC in the first half of the year. It gets my vote for the best drama of all time.

[Community](http://www.nbc.com/community/) - one of the smartest and most brilliant comedies in recent memory. It's a shame NBC doesn't get it and has decided to "bench" it for the immediate future. It doesn't get good Nielson rating because a majority of their audience watches it on Netflix/Hulu/DVR/etc.

[Thor](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/) - it won't win any awards for best screenplay, but 1) it was a beautiful movie with great special effects, and 2) the closer we get to an Avengers movie, the more this geek gets excited!

## Favorite Restaurant

[Rachel's Creperie](http://www.rachelscreperie.com) - at the end of the block of my new co-working space, offers a new way to try many kinds of foods you'd normally just slap in between two pieces of boring bread.

## Favorite Game

[Farkle!](http://youtube.com/watch?v=lPVgqEd8noA) - the link explains all of the rules.  All it requires is 6 dice and 1 or more friends. It channels Yahtzee but has some fun twists. 

## Favorite Mobile App

[Words With Friends](http://www.wordswithfriends.com/) - I know it's more like the game of 2010, but this year they added the Android version so I can play Facebook and iPhone friends, and it gives my brain a quick puzzle when I have some downtime.

## Favorite Technology Innovation

Music in the Cloud, either [Google Music](http://music.google.com/about/), [Amazon Cloud Player](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=2658409011), or [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) - they make listening to the same music on my laptop and my phone a snap. Sync-less bliss...  

## Favorite Cause

It wasn't new to 2011, but I think 2011 is when [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com) really became huge. It's amazing to see peoples' dreams come to life.
